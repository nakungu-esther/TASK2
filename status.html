    <h1>fishing in uganda</h1>
    <p>Sport Fishing in Uganda is not well marketed by the government despite having many water bodies. In fact, about 25% of Uganda is covered by water. In Lake Victoria, Uganda has the largest Lake in the African continent. Uganda is the source of the longest river in the world, River Nile. Uganda also has Lakes like George, Edward, Albert and Kyoga. All these water bodies present great opportunities for sport fishing. Some of the worldâ€™s famous anglers have gone fishing in Uganda. They include Jeremy Wade, John Wilson and Zeb Hogan of the National Geographic Channel.</p>
